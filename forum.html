                a dog. Ever since I got snowflake, I've realised that I've just generally been in a better mood and I've started
                feeling more engaged in activities as well. Maybe it's just because I'm a softie for dogs or maybe I've just
                found a different method of receiving love but nothing really has improved my mental health as much as snowflake has.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"> If I had to guess, I'd bet that its the warmth and love I get from him just being around me that helps so much.
                I guess thats the only thing that I haven't found before so its just such a new experience for me. If any of you
                have had similar experiences, def tell me about it, I'm curious to know. </p>

                Like yesterday I was just walking back home from the grocery store and I stopped by a bakery to pick up something
                and I saw these rainbow colored macarons which reminded me of Alex. Actually, it probably was the rainbow
                considering how he used to have this travel pillow that looked like a rainbow. Like yesterday I was just walking back home from the grocery store and I stopped by a bakery to pick up something
